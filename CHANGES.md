   - Added helper script to run example with proper environment setup
   - Checks for API key presence
   - Creates output directory if it doesn't exist
   - Sets up debugging environment

2. **CHANGES.md** (this file)
   - Documents all changes made to fix the path normalization issues

## Implementation Guide Updated

Updated the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md with:
- Information about robust path handling
- Troubleshooting steps for path-related errors
- Instructions for running the example script
- Additional next steps for future enhancements

## Key Improvements

1. **Path Normalization**
   - All paths are now consistently normalized using `path.resolve()`
   - Directory creation uses absolute paths to avoid relative path issues
   - Improved path validation prevents path traversal attacks

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
   - Better error messages with specific details
   - Graceful degradation for recoverable errors

3. **Logging**
   - Enhanced logging with more detailed information
   - Debug logs for path resolution and validation
   - Clear error messages for troubleshooting

4. **Security**
   - Improved path validation to prevent path traversal attacks
   - Better handling of file permissions
   - More secure file operations

5. **Robustness**
   - Added null checks to prevent null pointer exceptions
   - Better handling of edge cases
   - More resilient to API errors and file system issues
