Ensure step-2 is fully implemented before proceeding with the dependent steps. Investigate and resolve the code generation parsing errors to enable successful code generation for each step.",

Reorder the steps as follows: step-2, step-3, step-4, step-5, step-6, step-8, step-7.\n3. Update the step dependencies to reflect the new order.\n4. Investigate and fix the code generation parsing errors.\n5. Proceed with implementing each step in the revised order, generating code as needed.",
