    "The recent unblock action successfully identified the root cause of the dependency issues in the plan - the strict sequential ordering of steps.",
    "The recommended solution is to reorder the steps to allow for parallel execution where possible, while maintaining necessary dependencies.",
    "Specific step changes were provided, such as moving the initial setup step to the beginning, and reordering documentation and testing steps.",
    "The previous unblock attempts also identified similar dependency issues and recommended reordering steps.",
    "The plan has gone through multiple revisions due to these dependency problems, indicating a need for a more thorough restructuring."
  ],
  "recommendation": "Revise the plan by implementing the recommended step changes from the recent unblock action. Carefully analyze the dependencies between steps and restructure the plan to optimize for parallel execution. Ensure that each step has its dependencies met before execution.",
  "planRevisionStrategy": "1. Move the initial setup step to the beginning of the plan. 2. Split the increment and decrement button implementation to allow for parallel execution. 3. Reorder the documentation step to be after implementation but before testing. 4. Reorder the testing step to be after all implementation steps. 5. Review all step dependencies and reorder as needed to prevent blocking.",
