  "planRevisionStrategy": "Revise the plan to include a new high-priority step for investigating and resolving the code generation API response parsing issue. Make this step a dependency for all code generation steps. Adjust the order and dependencies of subsequent steps as needed based on the resolution of the parsing issue.",
