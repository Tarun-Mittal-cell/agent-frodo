  "planRevisionStrategy": "1. Add a new initial step to set up the project and create a basic React component structure. 2. Reorder the existing steps so that each step comes after its dependencies. 3. Move the testing step to come after the component is fully implemented and styled. 4. Place the documentation step at the end, after testing is complete.",
