    "This code generation failure is blocking progress on setting up the project and implementing the Counter component.",
    "The root cause of the invalid JSON response needs to be identified and resolved before development can proceed.",
    "Debugging the code generation process and API will be necessary to gather more information about the failure."
  ],
  "recommendation": "Conduct research on debugging code generation failures and invalid JSON responses. Gather information to help identify the root cause of the failure. Once the issue is better understood, determine if the code generation API needs to be fixed or if there are workarounds that can be implemented in the short-term to unblock development.",
  "planRevisionStrategy": "The current plan does not need revision at this stage. The existing step to investigate and fix the React code generation failure is still valid and should remain the top priority. Once the code generation issue is resolved, the plan can be re-evaluated to determine if any adjustments are needed before proceeding with the blocked implementation tasks.",
