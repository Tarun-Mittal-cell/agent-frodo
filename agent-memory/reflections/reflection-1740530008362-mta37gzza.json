    "The recent unblock action successfully identified the root cause of the dependency issues in the plan - a missing initial step (step-1) that subsequent steps depend on.",
    "The proposed solution involves adding the missing step-1 to set up the project and component structure, and reordering some steps to maintain a logical progression.",
    "By implementing the suggested step changes, the plan can be unblocked and the development can proceed smoothly.",
    "The plan revisions address the cascading dependency issues and allow for a more efficient workflow.",
    "No further research is needed at this point, as the unblock action provided a clear analysis and solution to the identified issues."

  "recommendation": "Revise the plan by adding the missing step-1 as suggested in the unblock action result. Reorder step-7 (documentation) to the end of the plan, after step-8 (testing). Once the plan is updated, proceed with the development following the revised step order.",
  "planRevisionStrategy": "1. Add a new step (step-1) to set up the project and initialize the React component, including creating the project structure, installing dependencies, and generating basic component files.\n2. Update the dependencies of the existing steps to include step-1 where needed.\n3. Reorder step-7 (documentation) to be the last step in the plan, after step-8 (testing).\n4. Adjust the step numbering if needed to maintain a consistent sequence.",
