    "The recent unblock_plan action successfully identified the root cause of the blocked steps as a missing or incomplete step-2.",
    "The unblock_plan action provided a clear solution to unblock the plan by modifying step-2 and reordering the subsequent steps based on their dependencies.",
    "Previous code generation attempts for step-1 and step-2 failed due to parsing errors in the response, suggesting potential issues with the code generation system.",
    "The current plan's progress is 0% with 0 completed steps and 6 pending steps, indicating that the development process is still in the early stages."

  "recommendation": "Revise the plan by implementing the changes suggested by the unblock_plan action. Ensure step-2 is fully implemented and reorder the subsequent steps based on their dependencies. Monitor the code generation process closely to identify and resolve any parsing issues.",
  "planRevisionStrategy": "1. Modify step-2 to ensure it is present and fully implemented.\n2. Reorder steps 3-8 based on the recommended order from the unblock_plan action.\n3. Update step statuses and dependencies to reflect the revised plan.\n4. Attempt code generation for each step, starting with step-2, and closely monitor the responses for parsing errors.",
