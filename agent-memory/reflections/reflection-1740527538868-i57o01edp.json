    "The recent action to generate code for the Counter component failed due to an issue with parsing the React code generation response.",
    "The error message suggests the response is not valid JSON, which is preventing the code from being generated successfully.",
    "This blocker needs to be resolved before proceeding with the other implementation steps, as they depend on the Counter component being created first.",
    "Investigating and fixing this code generation issue has become the top priority and should be added as a new high-complexity step in the plan."
  ],
  "recommendation": "Revise the plan to add a new step focused on debugging and resolving the React code generation failure. This step should be completed before moving forward with the other implementation tasks. Conduct research to better understand the cause of the error and potential solutions.",
  "planRevisionStrategy": "Add a new high-priority step to the beginning of the plan titled 'Investigate and fix React code generation failure'. Move the 'Set up project' step to blocked status until this issue is resolved. Update the dependencies of the existing steps to reflect the new step order.",
