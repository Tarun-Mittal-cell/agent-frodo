  "planRevisionStrategy": "1. Add a new initial step to set up the project and install dependencies.\n2. Reorder the steps based on their dependencies to ensure a logical execution order.\n3. Modify the dependency of 'step-7' to depend on 'step-6' instead of 'step-8'.\n4. Move 'step-7' to be executed after 'step-6' and before 'step-8'.\n5. Split 'step-5' into two separate steps: one for creating the CSS module and another for styling the components.\n6. Adjust the dependencies of the split steps accordingly.",
