    "The recent code generation action for step 1 failed due to an 'Unexpected token' error when trying to parse the response as JSON.",
    "This indicates an issue with the AI system's ability to generate valid React code or properly format the response.",
    "The error is blocking progress on the plan, as step 1 is a dependency for all subsequent steps.",
    "Previous unblock attempts have successfully resolved plan dependency issues, but this code generation error is a new blocker."

  "recommendation": "Conduct research into debugging the React code generation error and common causes of JSON parsing failures. If no solution is found, consider reporting the issue to the AI system's developers for further investigation and support.",
  "planRevisionStrategy": "The current plan structure looks good after the previous unblocking actions and does not need further revision at this time. The focus should be on resolving the code generation error.",
