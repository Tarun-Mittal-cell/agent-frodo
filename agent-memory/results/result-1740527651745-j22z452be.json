Step 6 is missing steps 3 and 5, while step 7 is missing steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. This suggests that step 2 is a crucial prerequisite for most of the other steps in the plan.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues appears to be the absence of step 2 in the plan. Many of the subsequent steps rely on the completion of step 2 before they can be executed.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, step 2 should be added to the plan and placed before steps 3, 4, and 5. This will ensure that the necessary dependencies are met for these steps. Additionally, the order of steps 6 and 7 should be adjusted to come after their respective dependencies are completed.",
