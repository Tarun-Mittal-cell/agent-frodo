        "analysis": "The blocked plan has a linear dependency chain where each step depends on the previous one. This causes a cascading effect where a single blocked step prevents all subsequent steps from being completed. The root issue is that step-1 is missing, which is a prerequisite for step-2. Without step-1, the entire plan is blocked.",
        "rootCause": "The plan is missing the initial step (step-1) that other steps depend on. This could be an oversight in the plan creation process or an indication that the prerequisite work for step-1 has not been completed.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, we need to add the missing step-1 and ensure it is completed before proceeding with the dependent steps. If step-1 already exists but is not referenced correctly, we should update the dependencies to point to the correct step. Once step-1 is in place and completed, the subsequent steps can be executed in order.",
