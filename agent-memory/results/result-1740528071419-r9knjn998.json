        "analysis": "The blocked plan has several steps with missing dependencies. Step 3, 4, and 5 are all missing step 2 as a dependency. Step 6 is missing steps 3 and 5, while step 7 is missing steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. This indicates that step 2 is a crucial prerequisite for most of the other steps and needs to be completed before the others can proceed.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues is that step 2 has not been included in the plan, despite being a necessary prerequisite for the majority of the other steps. Without step 2, the other steps cannot be completed, leading to the current blockage.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, step 2 should be added to the plan and placed before steps 3, 4, and 5. This will ensure that the necessary prerequisite is completed before the dependent steps are attempted. Additionally, the order of the steps should be reviewed to ensure a logical progression and to avoid any further dependency issues.",
