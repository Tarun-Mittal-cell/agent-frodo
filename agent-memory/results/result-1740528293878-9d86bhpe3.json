Step 6 is missing steps 3 and 5, while step 7 is missing steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. This suggests that step 2 is a crucial prerequisite for most of the other steps in the plan.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues appears to be the absence of step 2, which is required by the majority of the subsequent steps. Without completing step 2, the other steps cannot proceed as they rely on its output or state.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, step 2 should be prioritized and completed first. Once step 2 is finished, steps 3, 4, and 5 can be executed concurrently. After steps 3 and 5 are done, step 6 can be performed. Finally, step 7 can be completed after all its dependencies (steps 2, 3, 4, and 5) are fulfilled.",
