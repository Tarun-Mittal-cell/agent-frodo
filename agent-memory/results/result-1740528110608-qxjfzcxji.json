Step 6 is missing steps 3 and 5, while step 7 is missing steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. This indicates that step 2 is a crucial prerequisite for most of the other steps in the plan.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues is that step 2 has not been completed, and it is a required dependency for the majority of the remaining steps. Without completing step 2, the other steps cannot proceed.",

After steps 3 and 5 are completed, step 6 can be performed. Finally, step 7 can be executed once steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all finished.",
