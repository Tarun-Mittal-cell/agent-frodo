        "analysis": "The blocked plan has several steps with missing dependencies. Step 3, 4, and 5 are all missing step 2 as a dependency. Step 6 is missing steps 3 and 5, while step 7 is missing steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. This suggests that step 2 is a crucial prerequisite for most of the other steps and needs to be completed first.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues is that step 2 has not been defined as a prerequisite for the subsequent steps that depend on it. Without completing step 2, the other steps cannot proceed.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, step 2 should be defined and completed first. Then, steps 3, 4, and 5 can be executed in parallel since they depend only on step 2. Once steps 3 and 5 are complete, step 6 can be executed. Finally, after steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 are finished, step 7 can be completed.",
