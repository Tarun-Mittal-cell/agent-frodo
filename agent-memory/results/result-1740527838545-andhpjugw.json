        "analysis": "The blocked plan has several steps with missing dependencies. Step 3, 4, and 5 are all missing step 2 as a dependency. Step 6 is missing steps 3 and 5, while step 7 is missing steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. This suggests that step 2 is a crucial prerequisite for most of the other steps and needs to be completed first.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues is that step 2 has not been defined as a prerequisite for the subsequent steps that rely on it. This has led to a chain of blocked steps that cannot proceed until step 2 is completed.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, the dependencies for each step need to be properly defined. Step 2 should be set as a prerequisite for steps 3, 4, 5, and 7. Step 3 and 5 should be added as prerequisites for step 6. Once these dependencies are established, the steps can be reordered to ensure a logical flow, with step 2 being completed first.",
