This suggests that step-2 is missing or incomplete, preventing the other steps from being completed. The steps related to styling (step-4, step-6) depend on the basic component structure and functionality being implemented first. Testing (step-8) and documentation (step-7) steps depend on the completion of the core functionality and styling.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues appears to be a missing or incomplete step-2, which is likely the step that involves creating the basic structure of the Counter component. Without this foundational step, the other steps that build upon it cannot be completed.",

This step should involve creating the basic structure of the Counter component, including the necessary hooks and state management. Once step-2 is in place, the other blocked steps can be completed in a logical order based on their dependencies.
