        "analysis": "The blocked plan has several steps with missing dependencies. Step 3, 4, and 5 are all missing step 2 as a dependency. Step 6 is missing steps 3 and 5, while step 7 is missing steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. This suggests that step 2 is a crucial prerequisite for most of the other steps and needs to be completed first.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues is that step 2 has not been included as a dependency for the subsequent steps. This has led to a cascading effect where multiple steps are blocked due to the missing prerequisite.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, step 2 should be added as a dependency for steps 3, 4, and 5. Once step 2 is completed, it will allow steps 3, 4, and 5 to proceed. Step 6 requires steps 3 and 5 to be finished, so it will become unblocked after those steps are completed. Finally, step 7 depends on steps 2, 3, 4, and 5, so it will be ready to start once all of those prerequisites are met.",
