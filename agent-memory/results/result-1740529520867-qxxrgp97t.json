        "analysis": "The blocked plan has several steps with missing dependencies. The steps are not ordered correctly based on their dependencies. For example, step-2 depends on step-1, but step-1 is not present in the plan. Similarly, step-3 depends on step-2, step-4 depends on step-3, and so on. The testing step (step-8) and documentation step (step-7) are also out of order.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues is the incorrect ordering of the steps. The steps are not arranged in a logical sequence that satisfies their dependencies. Some required steps are missing, and others are placed in the wrong order.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, the steps need to be reordered and missing dependencies added. First, add the missing step-1. Then, reorder the steps so that each step comes after its dependencies. Place the testing step (step-8) after the component is fully implemented and styled. Finally, put the documentation step (step-7) at the end, after testing is complete.",
