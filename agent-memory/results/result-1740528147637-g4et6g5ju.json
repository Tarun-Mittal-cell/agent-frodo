        "analysis": "The blocked plan has several steps with missing dependencies. Step 3, 4, and 5 are all missing step 2 as a dependency. Step 6 is missing steps 3 and 5, while step 7 is missing steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. This suggests that step 2 is a crucial prerequisite for most of the other steps and needs to be completed first.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues is that step 2 has not been defined as a prerequisite for the subsequent steps that depend on it. This has led to a cascading effect where multiple steps are blocked due to the absence of step 2.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, step 2 should be defined as a dependency for steps 3, 4, and 5. Once step 2 is completed, it will allow steps 3, 4, and 5 to proceed. Steps 6 and 7 will then be unblocked once their respective dependencies (steps 3, 4, and 5) are fulfilled.",
