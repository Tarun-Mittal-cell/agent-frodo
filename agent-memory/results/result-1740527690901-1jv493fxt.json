        "analysis": "The blocked steps all depend on step-2, which is not listed as a blocked step itself. This suggests that step-2 is missing from the plan altogether. Additionally, step-6 depends on step-3 and step-5, while step-7 depends on step-2, step-3, step-4, and step-5, creating a chain of dependencies.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the blockage appears to be the absence of step-2 in the plan. This missing step is preventing the execution of all the subsequent steps that depend on it.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, step-2 needs to be added to the plan before the dependent steps. The plan should be reordered to ensure that step-2 is completed before step-3, step-4, and step-5. Once these steps are unblocked, step-6 and step-7 can be executed in the appropriate order.",
