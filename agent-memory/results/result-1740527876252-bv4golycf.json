        "analysis": "The blocked plan has several steps with missing dependencies. Step 3, 4, and 5 are all missing step 2 as a dependency. Step 6 is missing steps 3 and 5, while step 7 is missing steps 2, 3, 4, and 5. This suggests that step 2 is a crucial prerequisite for most of the other steps and needs to be completed before the others can proceed.",
        "rootCause": "The root cause of the dependency issues appears to be that step 2 has not been included in the plan, despite being a necessary prerequisite for the majority of the other steps. Without step 2, the other steps are blocked and cannot be completed.",
        "solution": "To unblock the plan, step 2 should be added to the plan and placed before steps 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Once step 2 is complete, the other steps should be able to proceed without dependency issues. Additionally, the order of steps 6 and 7 may need to be adjusted to ensure they come after their respective dependencies.",
